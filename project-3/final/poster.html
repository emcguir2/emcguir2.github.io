                <p> For this assignment, we were to recreate a texture from a photograph using overlapping text. This text was made up of a paragraph describing the texture itself. The process of creating the texture was extremely tedious, as it was so detailed. I really liked the texture that I was eventually able to convey.   </p>

                <p> "This image depicts the rough end of a wooden log. The hard wood is jagged and has repeated bumps and imperfections in the cross-section of the log. In the image, the light reveals different cracks and the damage the wood endured. The coarse texture created from these imperfect bumps and ridges reflect the age and weathered texture of the wood itself. The wood has a gritty, dry, natural texture that contrasts the grainy cold concrete. The wood is extremely abrasive and rough. While it is solid, the light reveals that part of the wood are less firm and more withered and weak. The repeated concentric circles are alike but imprecise and vary." </p>
